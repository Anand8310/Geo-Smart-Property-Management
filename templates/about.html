            Welcome to Geo-Smart PMS, your all-in-one platform for modern property management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to solve the biggest challenges in the real estate market by integrating advanced geospatial technology with a comprehensive management system. We aim to provide a transparent, efficient, and data-driven experience for property owners, tenants, and service vendors.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Platform</h4>
        <p>We have built a sophisticated, multi-faceted application that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Property Marketplace:</strong> An interactive map with advanced filters for tenants to discover properties and see nearby points of interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Management System:</strong> A full suite of tools for owners and tenants to manage leases, invoices, and documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Marketplace:</strong> A complete workflow for owners to hire and manage approved vendors for maintenance tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Neighborhood Insights Hub:</strong> A powerful analytics dashboard to analyze property trends and market data in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Onboarding System:</strong> A professional workflow for tenants to apply for properties and for owners to approve or reject them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project was built to demonstrate the power of integrating a GIS backend (PostgreSQL with PostGIS) with a modern web framework (Python/Django) to solve complex, real-world problems.
